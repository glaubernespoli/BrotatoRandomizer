------

The following files were converted and saved to a non-original path, but did not have their import data rewritten.
These files will not be re-imported when loading the project.
res://resources/translations/translations.en.translation to res://.assets/resources/translations/translations.csv



---------------------------------IMPORTANT NOTES----------------------------------

WARNING: Could not recover 623 keys for translation.csv
Saved translations.csv to res://.assets/resources/translations/translations.csv
If you wish to modify the translation csv(s), you will have to manually find the missing keys, replace them in the csv, and then copy it back to the original path
Note: consider just asking the creator if you wish to add a translation


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Godot editor version 3.5 to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
